# Unity 2D Platformer Tutorial

This repository was uploaded to become more familiar with Unity with respect to 2D-Platformer games. 
It also serves as a test to integrate Github and Git LFS with Unity to use VCS in future projects.
Modifications to the tutorial template have been saved in this project. The game was modified to make use of 
the Move, Rotate, Scale, Rectangle Tools and the public fields in the Inspector Window. 
Added Mods with the assistance of Unity Tutorials as well ('A Splash of Color', 'Billboard Face', 'Add Trails', 'Tinted World', 'Animate Your World',
'Decorate Your World', 'Bouncy Sparky', 'Name the Game'). The game was uploaded to https://connect.unity.com/mg/2d/first_2d_platformer.
